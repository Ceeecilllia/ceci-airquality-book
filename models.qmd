# Models

We trained four different models using the preprocessed heart disease dataset:

- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Network

Each model was evaluated on a held-out test set using accuracy and AUC.

## Model Training Overview

Below is a summary of the methods and tools used:

- Models were implemented using the `tidymodels` framework in R.
- The dataset was split into training (70%) and test (30%) sets.
- Preprocessing (e.g., normalization or dummy variable creation) was applied using `recipes`.
- Each model used 10-fold cross-validation for tuning (if applicable).

## Model 1: Decision Tree

> You can insert code chunk here like:

```r
# Decision Tree with rpart
library(tidymodels)

tree_spec <- decision_tree() %>%
  set_engine("rpart") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

# Add recipe and workflow, then fit the model
