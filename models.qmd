# Models Overview

In this section, we provide an overview of the models used to predict heart disease based on clinical features.

We trained and evaluated **four different models**, each representing a different level of complexity and interpretability:

| Model             | Engine     | Type               | Interpretability | Notes                           |
|------------------|------------|--------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| Decision Tree     | `rpart`    | Interpretable      | High             | Baseline tree model              |
| Random Forest     | `ranger`   | Ensemble           | Medium           | Handles interactions, more robust |
| SVM               | `kernlab`  | Kernel-based       | Low              | Sensitive to scaling             |
| Neural Network    | `nnet`     | Nonlinear          | Low              | Can model complex patterns       |

Each model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve)
- Global feature importance (e.g., using `vip` or built-in model metrics)
- LIME local explanations

# Modeling Workflow

We use the [`tidymodels`](https://www.tidymodels.org/) framework for consistency and reproducibility across models:

- Split data: 70% training / 30% test
- Recipe preprocessing: dummy encoding, normalization, etc.
- 10-fold cross-validation for tuning (if applicable)
- Evaluation on test set

Each model is analyzed in its own chapter:

- [Decision Tree](tree_model.qmd)
- [Random Forest](rf_model.qmd)
- [SVM](svm_model.qmd)
- [Neural Network](nn_model.qmd)

This modular approach allows us to compare different modeling philosophies and investigate how interpretation methods like LIME behave across them.
