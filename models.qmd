We trained five different models on the heart disease prediction dataset:

- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Neural Network**
- **Logistic Regression**

All models were implemented using the `tidymodels` framework in R. The dataset was split into 70% training and 30% testing. 

Each model includes preprocessing via `recipes`, and uses cross-validation or default settings depending on the complexity.  
Model explanations using LIME are further discussed in the next chapter.

| Model                | Description                                                    |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Logistic Regression | A linear model for binary classification, interpretable weights|
| Decision Tree       | A tree-based model using `rpart`, easy to visualize and explain|
| Random Forest       | An ensemble of trees, generally improves accuracy               |
| SVM                 | Support Vector Machine with polynomial kernel                   |
| Neural Network      | A single-layer neural network using `nnet`                      |

These models are compared in terms of predictive performance and explainability in later sections.
