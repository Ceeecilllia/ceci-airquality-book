# Data

## Dataset Description

We use the **Heart Failure Prediction** dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction).  
This dataset includes clinical features of patients and a binary outcome variable indicating whether the patient is diagnosed with heart disease.

There are `n = 918` rows and `p = 12` columns in the dataset.  
Some of the key features include:

- `Age`: Age of the patient
- `RestingBP`: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
- `Cholesterol`: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- `ChestPainType`: Type of chest pain (e.g., ATA, NAP, ASY, TA)
- `FastingBS`: Fasting blood sugar (>120 mg/dl, binary: 1 or 0)
- `MaxHR`: Maximum heart rate achieved
- `ExerciseAngina`: Exercise-induced angina (Yes/No)
- `HeartDisease`: Target variable (1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease)

## Preprocessing Steps

Before modeling, we apply the following preprocessing steps:

- Convert categorical variables (e.g., `Sex`, `ChestPainType`, `ExerciseAngina`, `RestingECG`, `ST_Slope`) into factors
- Standardize numerical variables if needed (for SVM or neural networks)
- Check for and handle missing values (if any)
- Split the data into training and test sets (e.g., 70% training, 30% testing)

We will use this cleaned dataset to train our four models and evaluate LIME explanations.
