# Conclusion

In this project, we explored the use of LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to interpret machine learning models for predicting heart disease.

We trained and evaluated four models:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Network

We then applied LIME to generate local explanations and compared them to model-based feature importance.

## Key Findings

- LIME explanations aligned more closely with simpler models like decision trees.
- For more complex models (e.g., neural networks), the LIME feature rankings showed greater variability.
- Some features such as `Age`, `ChestPainType`, and `Cholesterol` were consistently important across models and explanations.

## Limitations

- LIME explanations are local and may not reflect the global model behavior.
- The comparison is limited to one dataset and a small sample of instances.
- Model hyperparameters and preprocessing choices could affect results.

## Future Directions

- Explore other interpretability methods such as SHAP or Anchor explanations.
- Apply the same analysis to other medical prediction datasets.
- Involve domain experts (e.g., clinicians) to assess explanation usefulness in real-world decision-making.

This project highlights both the potential and the caution needed when interpreting machine learning models, especially in healthcare.
