This project explores interpretable machine learning methods to predict the likelihood of heart disease from patient clinical data. 

We build and compare five models:

- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Network
- Logistic Regression

Our primary goal is **not only to achieve high predictive accuracy**, but also to understand **why** a model makes certain predictions.

The dataset used in this project is the UCI Heart Disease dataset, which contains 14 clinical variables such as age, sex, cholesterol, and resting blood pressure, along with a binary outcome variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease. In this dataset, a value of 1 means the individual was diagnosed with heart disease, while 0 indicates no heart disease.

To achieve our objectives, we applied several modeling and explanation techniques. These include model training using the `tidymodels` framework, evaluation based on test set Accuracy and AUC, and feature importance analysis using built-in tools like `rpart`, `randomForest`, and `glm`. Additionally, we used local explanation methods such as **LIME** for tree-based models and the `iml::LocalModel` package for logistic regression.

The broader goals of our project are to compare interpretable models with black-box models, evaluate the stability and reliability of their explanations, and assess whether these models are trustworthy for medical use.
