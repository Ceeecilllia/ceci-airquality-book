## Overview

This project explores interpretable machine learning methods to predict the likelihood of heart disease from patient clinical data.

We build and compare five models:

- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Network
- Logistic Regression

Our primary goal is **not only to achieve high predictive accuracy**, but also to understand **why** a model makes certain predictions.

---

## Dataset

We use the UCI Heart Disease dataset, containing 14 clinical variables (e.g., age, sex, cholesterol, resting blood pressure) and a binary outcome indicating the presence of heart disease, which includes 14 clinical features and a binary target variable:

- `1` = diagnosed with heart disease
- `0` = no heart disease

---

## Methods

We apply the following modeling and explanation techniques:

- 🧠 **Model training** via the `tidymodels` framework
- 📈 **Evaluation** using test set Accuracy and AUC
- 🔍 **Global feature importance** using built-in tools (e.g., rpart, randomForest, glm)
- 🌈 **Local explanations** using `lime` (for tree-based models) and `iml::LocalModel` (for logistic regression)

---

## Goals

- Compare interpretable vs black-box models
- Evaluate the **stability and reliability** of explanations
- Discuss whether models are **trustworthy for medical use**
