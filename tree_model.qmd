## Decision Tree Model

We trained a decision tree model to predict heart disease using the `rpart` engine via the `tidymodels` framework. This model is inherently interpretable and serves as a baseline for comparison.

### Data Split and Preprocessing

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
# Load the dataset
heart <- read_csv("data/heart.csv")

# Rename + factor conversion
heart <- heart %>%
  rename(
    Age = age,
    Sex = sex,
    ChestPainType = cp,
    RestingBP = trestbps,
    Cholesterol = chol,
    FastingBS = fbs,
    RestingECG = restecg,
    MaxHR = thalach,
    ExerciseAngina = exang,
    Oldpeak = oldpeak,
    Slope = slope,
    NumMajorVessels = ca,
    Thalassemia = thal,
    HeartDisease = target
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    Sex = as.factor(Sex),
    ChestPainType = as.factor(ChestPainType),
    RestingECG = as.factor(RestingECG),
    ExerciseAngina = as.factor(ExerciseAngina),
    Thalassemia = as.factor(Thalassemia),
    HeartDisease = as.factor(HeartDisease)
  )

```
